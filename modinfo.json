	"description": "Thrall Automated Gathering (TAG) is a mod designed to automate the process of collecting resources. While your thralls spend all their time standing around, now they can be useful while you're AFK. Using the new feats (Search for TAG in your feats list) provided to unlock the recipes.\nYou should have access to the Hunting Table or Gathering Table.  Add a Warrior or Archer thrall to the workbench to increase the crafting queue up to 5 (close and re-open bench to update). Use the recipes to find the things you want to hunt and what tools to harvest them with. Set your thralls loose and reap the rewards. Better tier tools yield better results for the hunting bench (gathering bench uses the tool teir to determine what you're gathering).\n\nBoth benches will auto-queue.  I wouldn't leave any extra tools inside the benches as that could result in a different recipe being chosen when the current one completes.  Each recipe takes 1 hour per cycle (this is designed for long-term income).  Leave it running overnight to come back to a full inventory.  Benches will auto-stop once they have 100 items in their inventory, and will remain 'full' until you've cleared some space.  This does cancel the recipes in progress, so keep an eye on your benches.\n\nUPDATE:\nT2 and T3 benches have been added.  T2s can have 7 parallel recipes, and t3s have 10!  T2 and T3 benches will 'process' their gathering results.  E.G. gather meat, and your bench will cook it right afterward.  T2 and T3 benches match vanilla in the fact that they have a 'fast' and 'efficient' version(s).  Reducing base resource costs and fuel or inceasing speed (while costing a bit more fuel).  T2 and T3 hunting table will require grilled steak or gruel to run (grilled steak can be gathers and auto-cooked from the bench).  T2 and T3 gathering benches require coal (which you can gather from the bench).\n\nBug List:\n\nTODO:\n- [strike]Add a Resource Collection bench for automating resource collection (stone, iron, etc.)[/strike]\n- [strike]Create a 'stop' point when the bench inventory hits 100.  This should prevent anyone from over-harvesting.[/strike]\n- [strike]Automated processing (cooking, smelting, etc.) via bench upgrades[/strike]\n- Taskmaster thralls to increase crafting speeds\n- Create Ways to mark the benches as working/crafting without opening them (like how you see a smelter running)\n- Update Icons to use more than the vanilla game assets so they're more descriptive\n- Update bench models to be something unique.\n- ?Add progressive gathering recipes (better tools = more resources)?\n\nAll Feats, Items, Recipes, etc. start with TAG to help categorize them.\nhttps://github.com/dracahn/CE-ThrallAutomatedGathering",
